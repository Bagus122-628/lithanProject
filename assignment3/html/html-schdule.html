                Prerequisites
    
                Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively 
                (i.e. just looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing basic 
                software, and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files — both are parts of our Getting started 
                with the web complete beginner's module.
                
                It is recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before attempting this topic. However, this isn't absolutely 
                necessary; much of what is covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module, albeit in a lot more 
                detail.
                
                After learning HTML, you can then move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:
                
                    CSS, and how to use it to style HTML (for example alter your text size and fonts used, add borders and drop shadows, layout your page
                     with multiple columns, add animations and other visual effects.)
                    JavaScript, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example find your location and plot it on a map, 
                    make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a button, save users' data locally on their computers, and much more.)

                    <p>Modules

                        This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.
                        
                        Introduction to HTML
                        
                            This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax, looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a webpage.
                        Multimedia and embedding
                        
                            This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.
                        HTML tables
                        
                            Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing captions and summaries.
